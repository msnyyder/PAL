PAL (Preserving Academic Life) - Read Me
Lillian Davis, Michaela Snyder, Eric Xing

The developers of this software project are all members of the CS 496 Spring 2023 Senior Project course at WKU. The goal of the PAL website is to assist the target audience, those in some way affiliated with the CS and Math departments at WKU, in organizing and maintaining their daily and semester schedules. The website is mainly divided into two applications, a Course Registration page and a Task Manager site. Both applications are designed to create a user-oriented scheduler website; focusing on goals such as ease of use, high levels of organization, and accurate and helpful course schedule advice.

This document will provide instructions for readers to recreate or access the PAL system. This file will also detail some of the main aspects of the site including how data is separated and accessed within the application.

Users should now be able to access all areas of the website and test accordingly.
